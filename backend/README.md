You should generate ssl keys with `make gen-ssl-cert` in the current directory. \
You should also generate the keys for the tests with `make keys-rsa` and `make keys-sym` in the `identity` directory. \
Start with `docker compose up --build` in the current directory. \ 
TIP: \
I made that `79*******1` is the phone of existing user. \
`79*******0` is the phone of not existing user. \
`79*******2` is the phone which usage will fail.
